Branching strategy

-> Devlopers creates feature branch for thier own purpose and merge it to the dev branch.
-> DevOps team creates release branch and merge them to the dev branch.
-> Developers can pull the changes from master branch but they cannot push the changes to the master.
Branch 
-> Branch is used for parallel development.
-> If two people/two teams working on a same piece of code on two differnt branches., then later we can integrate by merging.
